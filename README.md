distributron
============

Distributron is an in-development software solution for distribution centers. Its main objective is to
manage inventory and shipments.

Distributron is being developed as a solution for a non-profit distribution center for charitable
organizations. My hope is that it can be general-purpose enough to maybe benefit others with similar
needs. Therefore, a design goal is to make this white label and configuration-driven.
